# Why a monorepo?

In the past, I've created [lots of repos on GitHub](https://github.com/patmaddox?tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=&sort=).
I have hundreds - possibly thousands - of little repos and experiments that I've never pushed, all sitting on my computer.
I have no idea how many times I've run `mktemp -d` to try something out.
They're not all worth keeping, and certainly not all worth sharing.
But, I find it harder and harder to locate code ideas.
They're spread all over the place.
