# patmaddox.com

- write in markdown (and maybe org)
- content is agnostic of the deployment tool - keep it all in a dir
- eventually I would like a LiveView app, that integrates with libjj to show commit history
- it could also be cool to build the site with multiple engines
- sitemap with validator - make sure that if I change URLs, old URLs still work (redirect)
