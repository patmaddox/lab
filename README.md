Each dir in `src` has a fetch target to clone the repo.

## TODO

- [ ] build: make `plz query changes` work with jj
- [ ] emacs: markdown list-aware sorting (if an item contains multiple
      lines, it breaks sort)
- [ ] emacs: sentence-aware line wrapping
- [ ] freebsd-ports: build a poudriere jail
- [ ] freebsd-ports: tar the ports dir - I think this will be a bit
      faster since please will not have to check every file
- [ ] freebsd-ports: update `please`
- [ ] freebsd-ports: update my maintained ports
- [ ] freebsd-src: build a boot environment for my desktop
- [ ] freebsd-src: set the version number (commit count and hash)
