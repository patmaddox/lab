* Infrastructure
The goal:

- build my infrastructure entirely from source
- easily
- document it well

Systems:

- [ ] beastie (workstation)
- [ ] gulliver (laptop)
- [ ] andre (server)
- [ ] rowdy (router)
- [ ] patmaddox.com
- [ ] poudriere?

Challenges:

- Need a stable, backwards-compatible kernel to install packages,
  because some packages run software
- Build systems are annoying
- How do I know when ~make buildworld buildkernel~ has completed
  successfully? I suppose I could run it through ~tee~ and grep the
  output, or write a sentinel file.  Sentinel file seems the easiest -
  delete it when the build starts, write it when build finishes.
- Building ~freebsd-src~ really wants it to go under ~/usr/obj~ rather
  than wherever I want it to build.
